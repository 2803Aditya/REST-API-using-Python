# Introduction
## About RESTful API
- A RESTful API (also known as REST API) is an application programming interface (API or web API).
- It a way for two computer systems to communicate over HTTP in a similar way to web browsers and servers. 
- REST stands for representational state transfer.<br/><br/>
### A RESTful web service request contains:<br/>
**An Endpoint URL**: An application implementing a RESTful API will define one or more URL endpoints with a domain, port, path, and/or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;querystring â€” for example,    https://mydomain/user/123?format=json.

**The HTTP method**: Differing HTTP methods can be used on any endpoint which map to application create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations:

- HTTP method	CRUD	Action
- GET	read	returns requested data
- POST	create	creates a new record
- PUT or PATCH	update	updates an existing record
- DELETE	delete	deletes an existing record

**Body Data**: Data is normally transmitted in the HTTP body in an identical way to HTML (form) submissions or by sending a single 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JSON-encoded data string.
